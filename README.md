### PADA
A PAthway Dynamics Analyzer using probabilistic approximation techniques

### About

PADA can analyze the dynamics of biological pathway models using dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) based approximation techniques. It supports System Biology Mark-up Language (SBML) format and has a GPU-based implementation for high-performance computing.
